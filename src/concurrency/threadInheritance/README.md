## Welcome to concurrency!

###  In this package, the source files introduce:

1. how to instantiate threads with the Thread class directly
2. how to extend the Thread class
3. how threads interact (our first threaded program!)

###  Study the files in this order:

1. ExtendingThread.java 
2. ThreadingInAction.java 
3. MultiExecutor.java.
